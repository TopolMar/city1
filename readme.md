## Report on my design decisions for this site

**• Why you designed it like this (navigation, layout, colour choices)**
I tried to provide links to each photo and text to the original source, none of the materials used, photo text and video, belong to me.
also the font is different

Each page has CSS and Bootstrap elements.
 CSS elements are entered into the HTML code without creating a separate file. The color of the pages and the type of the font are configured with the help of CSS. The color is occasionally specified as a name (blue purple) or type # to demonstrate the capabilities of the CSS.

Each page has Bootstrap elements of different versions. For example, a carousel was used to demonstrate the possibilities.
Pages are optimized for different device sizes using Bootstrap.

Each page has different styled banners to showcase the options.
Each page has links to other pages of the project.

The project is connected to GitHub and kept in progress with comments added.
Features:
1. index.html:
Map and chunk of information in containers. The chunk of information is surrounded by a border.
In the future, the site is divided into 3 columns. Each column has text that becomes visible after clicking on the button, which are photos. The buttons turn black when hovered over as a design step.
Link to the city's official website.
Direct insertion of a video from YouTube with a link.
2. history.html
Divided into three tabs. There are two containers in each tab. One container has text, the other has a signed photo that is a button with a link to the original source.
Below is a carousel with photos of the city to demonstrate the possibilities of Bootstrap.
3. visit.html
The page is divided into two 7:5 columns. The left column has the names of recommended places and buttons that open information about them. The right column has round photos. Each photo is signed and has a link to the original source.

**• What challenges you faced**

First, I'm terrible at designing and creating layouts, so this project is more about using the tools we have than the layout. I tried to add things that show the possibilities and at the same time keep it simple.
Secondly, Connecting to github was unexpectedly challenging and I spent more time on it than expected.
