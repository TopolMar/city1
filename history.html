         The history of Kyiv officially begins with its founding year as 482, but the city may date back at least 2,000 years. Archaeology dates the site of the oldest known settlement in the area to 25,000 years BC. Kyiv was the historical capital of medieval Kievan Rus' from 879 to 1240, and is now the largest city and the capital of Ukraine.

        Legend states that three brothers, Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv, and their sister Lybid, founded the city. Kyiv thus takes its name from Kyi, the eldest brother. The exact century of the city's foundation has not been determined. Legend has it that Saint Andrew (d. AD 60/70) prophesied the emergence of a great city on the future location of Kyiv. He was allegedly fascinated by the spectacular location on the hilly shores of the Dnipro River. The city is thought to have existed as early as the 6th century, initially as a Slavic settlement. Gradually acquiring eminence as the center of the East Slavic civilization, Kyiv reached its Golden Age as the center of Kievan Rus' in the 10th–12th centuries.

        Its political, but not cultural, importance drastically declined when, in 1169, it was pillaged by the troops of Andrey Bogolyubsky; the old town was destroyed, and the capital moved to Vladimir. This was followed by numerous sackings of Kyiv by Rus' princes until the town was completely destroyed during the Mongol invasion in 1240.

        In the following centuries, the city functioned as a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbors: the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, its successor the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Tsardom of Russia which later became the Russian Empire. Kyiv was also a major political and cultural center for Ukrainian nation, especially during the Ukrainian Cossack Hetmanate in 17–18 centuries. A Christian city since 988, it still played an important role in preserving the traditions of Orthodox Christianity, especially at times of domination by Catholic Poland, and later the atheist Soviet Union.
